Introduction

* This app was commissioned by an alliance playing the mobile game Dawn of Titans. It is designed to assist in keeping the alliance organized as well as provide useful information and links for their members. It has a mobile first design as most of the users will be accessing this app from a mobile device.

Framework

* This app was built using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL.  It is currently only a static web app (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) but Rails and PostgreSQL are in place for the potential to add a user database in the future.
